# Fabric Reconfigurable Ops

This document specifies the set of software op kinds that the loom fabric dialect
can wrap inside a `fabric.op`, and which of those have runtime `sw_config` axes
that the subgraph enumerator explores. The canonical source is `opSchemas()` in
`lib/Fabric/IR/FabricOps.cpp`.

## Background

`fabric.op` is the sole bridge between software computation kinds (in `dataflow`,
`arith`, `math`, ...) and physical hardware capability. Every `fabric.op` carries:

- **`op_list`** -- a non-empty array of `FlatSymbolRefAttr`s. Names the software
  op kind(s) this hardware block can execute. When the array has more than one
  entry, all entries must belong to a single hardware-share group (see
  `spec-fabric-hw-share-group.md`).
- **`hw_params`** -- an optional length-1 array wrapping a dictionary of
  parameters that change the hardware itself. Modifying `hw_params` means
  changing the synthesized block. Examples: the bitmask allowed-set for a
  variadic `dataflow.sync`, the predicate allowed-set for a configurable
  `arith.cmpi`.
- **`sw_configs`** -- an optional dictionary of runtime configuration values that
  alter the materialized software function without changing the hardware.
  Examples: `op_sel` to pick a member of a share group, `bitmask` to pick the
  active subset of a variadic op, `predicate` to pick a comparison code.

The `op_list` is itself a special hardware parameter: its presence and contents
fix what the block can compute. The `op_sel` `sw_config` then chooses among the
listed members at runtime.

## Two axes that the enumerator explores

Inside a `fabric.fu`, exactly five op kinds carry **structural** `sw_config` axes
whose choices change the materialized software graph topology, not just attribute
values:

- `fabric.mux` -- `sel` + `discard` + `disconnect`
- `fabric.demux` -- `sel` + `discard` + `disconnect`
- `fabric.op[@dataflow.sync]` -- bitmask (M-bit, N <= M ones)
- `fabric.op[@dataflow.mux]` -- bitmask (same envelope)
- `fabric.op[@dataflow.demux]` -- bitmask (same envelope)

Beyond the five structural axes, the enumerator also explores **attribute** axes
when `hw_params` declares an allowed set for them. These do not change subgraph
topology; they parameterize an existing op:

- `op_sel` -- multi-member `op_list` share groups.
- `predicate` -- `arith.cmpi` / `arith.cmpf` predicates, when restricted by `hw_params`.
- `step_op`, `cont_cond` -- `dataflow.stream` axes, when restricted.
- `const_hex_value` -- `dataflow.constant`, when the hardware fixes the allowed
  value set via `hw_params` (otherwise this is a free runtime constant, not
  enumerated).

If `hw_params` does not declare an allowed set for one of the attribute axes,
that attribute is a free `sw_config` and the enumerator does not fan out across it.

## Runtime sw-configurable ops (the canonical seven)

The following op kinds support runtime reconfiguration via `sw_configs`. They are
the ones a hardware designer most commonly puts inside a `fabric.fu` to give the
FU programmable behavior.

| Software op | Configurable axes | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `dataflow.stream` | `step_op`, `cont_cond` (when restricted by `hw_params`) | A streaming source whose stride and continuation predicate can be re-fixed at config time. |
| `dataflow.sync` | bitmask over M ports | Variadic. Selects the active N <= M input/output port pairs. The remaining ports are pruned upstream and downstream from the materialized subgraph. |
| `dataflow.constant` | `const_hex_value` (when restricted by `hw_params`) | Compile-time-set runtime constant. Without `hw_params` restriction the value is a free `sw_config`, not enumerated. |
| `dataflow.mux` | bitmask over M data ports | Variadic. Bitmask selects N active data ports; materialized `sel` width is `i1` for N=2 and `index` for N>=3. Hardware port stays at `bits<ceil(log2(M))>`. Data-dependent gating (only consumes the selected data input). |
| `dataflow.demux` | bitmask over M output ports | Variadic. Mirror of mux: bitmask selects which output ports are active; only `outputs[sel]` carries a value at runtime. |
| `arith.cmpi` | `predicate` (when restricted by `hw_params`) | Integer comparison. Default is the full 10-way set; `hw_params=[{predicate=[...]}]` restricts to a hardware-allowed subset. |
| `arith.cmpf` | `predicate` (when restricted by `hw_params`) | Floating-point comparison; same enumeration shape as cmpi. |

These seven plus the share-group `op_sel` axis (any multi-member `op_list`) cover
every runtime `sw_config` knob the enumerator explores.

## Non-configurable ops (no sw_config axes)

The following ops are accepted in `op_list` but have no `sw_config` axes of their
own. The enumerator emits a single template per occurrence, modulo any other
configurable elements elsewhere in the FU.

- All single-output, fixed-arity arithmetic: `arith.{addi, subi, muli, divsi,
  divui, remsi, remui, shli, shrsi, shrui, andi, ori, xori, minsi, maxsi, minui,
  maxui, addf, subf, mulf, divf, remf, minimumf, maximumf}`.
- Integer-floating casts: `arith.{sitofp, uitofp, fptosi, fptoui}`.
- All `math.*` unary ops: `math.{sin, cos, tan, sinh, cosh, tanh, exp, exp2,
  expm1, log, log2, log10, log1p, floor, ceil, round, trunc, roundeven, sqrt,
  rsqrt, absf, absi, erf}`.
- Fixed-arity dataflow ops: `dataflow.{carry, invariant, gate}`.
- `arith.select` -- strict-SSA eager 2-input mux. Distinct semantics from
  `dataflow.mux` (eager evaluation, consumes both data inputs). Does not belong to
  any share group, must occupy `fabric.op` alone.

The runtime knobs an FU may carry for these come from the surrounding
`fabric.mux` / `fabric.demux` and the variadic ops, not from the op itself.

## Excluded ops

The following are deliberately not in `opSchemas()` and `fabric.op` will reject them:

- `llvm.alloca`, `ub.poison`, `arith.constant` -- these are compile-time or
  pseudo ops that have no fabric realization.
- `dataflow.{load, store}` -- memory ops that the partitioner handles separately
  (they live at graph level, not inside `fabric.fu`).
- `dataflow.{graph, yield}`, `dataflow.subgraph` -- region ops, not computations.

## How sw_configs become enumerator axes

The enumerator (`SubgraphEnumerator::enumerateFuSubgraphs`) walks each
`fabric.fu` body and builds a list of `ChoiceAxis` records. One axis is created
when:

- The op is a `fabric.mux` or `fabric.demux` -- yields a `_mode` axis covering all
  `(sel, discard, disconnect)` combinations.
- The op is `fabric.op[@dataflow.sync]`, `fabric.op[@dataflow.mux]`, or
  `fabric.op[@dataflow.demux]` -- yields a bitmask axis. The allowed bitmasks are
  taken from `hw_params=[{bitmask=[...]}]` if present; otherwise the full
  `2^M - 1` enumeration is used (capped at M = 8).
- The `fabric.op`'s `op_list` has more than one entry -- yields an `op_sel` axis
  with one value per member.
- The `fabric.op`'s `hw_params` declares an array allowed-set for a non-bitmask
  key (`predicate`, `step_op`, `cont_cond`, `const_hex_value`, ...) -- yields one
  axis per such key.

The Cartesian product of all axes is the raw configuration space. After
per-config materialization, the enumerator runs `subgraphsIsomorphic` between
every pair of surviving templates and keeps the lexicographically-smallest
configuration per isomorphism class.

## Design principle

Distinct `sw_configs` are intended to map to distinct software functions. If a
`fabric.fu` produces many software-isomorphic templates under different
`sw_configs`, that is a smell in the FU design itself, not in the enumerator. The
enumerator's dedup discards the redundant configurations deliberately.

## Maintenance

The canonical source of truth for the runtime sw-configurable set is
`opSchemas()` in `lib/Fabric/IR/FabricOps.cpp`. The `Variadic*` kinds
(`OpSchema::VariadicSync`, `VariadicMux`, `VariadicDemux`) flag which schema
entries get a bitmask axis; non-variadic schemas have an axis only when
`hw_params` restricts them. To extend either set, edit `opSchemas()` and add a
corresponding lit test under `test/fabric/unit/fu_enum/` that pins the new axis
behavior, then mirror the change here.
